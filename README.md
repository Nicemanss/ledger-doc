# INTRODUCTION
With the Ledger HPB app, you securely store your HPB assets in a Ledger Hardware Wallet. By using a Ledger Hardware Wallet, you don't run into the risk of someone knowing your private keys as the private keys are stored on the Ledger Hardware Wallet and not accessible through your personal computer and thus can not be copied by a third party.

# BEFORE YOU START

* An [initialized](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000613793) Ledger Nano S with the latest firmware [installed](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113)
* Ledger Live [installed and ready to use](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006395233)
* A web browser such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
