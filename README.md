# BEFORE YOU START
In order to secure HPB with a Ledger Nano S, you will need:

An [initialized](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000613793) Ledger Nano S with the latest firmware [installed](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113)
Ledger Live [installed and ready to use](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006395233)
Google Chrome [installed](https://www.google.com/chrome/)


# INSTALL THE HPB APP ON YOUR LEDGER NANO S USING LEDGER LIVE
1. Open the Manager in Ledger Live 
2. Connect and unlock your Ledger Nano S 
3. If asked, allow the manager on your device by pressing the right button
4. Find Ethereum in the app catalog, since the HPB app requires it 
5. Click the Install button of the app
* An installation window appears
* Your device will display Processing…
* The app installation is confirmed
6. Repeat steps 4 and 5 for HPB. 

> A quick note on addresses: Your Ledger Nano S will have generated a large number of private keys for you, each of which is identified by a public address. These keys and addresses are deterministic; that is, they'll be the same every time you use the device (or at least until you reset it and change your PIN). The public addresses, like most addresses in the HPB network, are long strings of seemingly random numbers and letters preceded by 0x. You can think of them like bank account numbers — except, unlike bank accounts, there is no personal data associated with them. Proof of ownership is established by the fact that you have possession of the Ledger Nano S and know its PIN.
