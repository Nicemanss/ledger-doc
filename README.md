# INTRODUCTION
With the Ledger HPB app, you securely store your HPB assets in a Ledger Hardware Wallet. By using a Ledger Hardware Wallet, you don't run into the risk of someone knowing your private keys as the private keys are stored on the Ledger Hardware Wallet and not accessible through your personal computer and thus can not be copied by a third party.

# PREREQUISITES
You will need the following in order to secure your HPB assets with a Ledger device:

* An [initialized](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000613793) Ledger Nano S with the latest firmware [installed](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113)
* Ledger Live [installed and ready to use](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006395233)
* A web browser supporting U2F such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)
* The Ethereum app installed on your ledger (due to HPB app inhereting code from the ETH app in order to save storage space).

# INSTALLING THE HPB APP ON YOUR LEDGER DEVICE
1. Open Ledger Live, and go to the **Manager** section

3. Give Ledger Live permissions to access your Ledger device by pressing the **right button** on your Ledger device 
4. In order to save storage space on Ledger Nano S (which has got a tiny amount of storage for applications compared to Ledger Nano X), Ledger deploys Ethereum as a "main" application all other coins that are derived from Ethereum then create apps that are tiny in comparisment as all of them utilize the code inside the ETH app. Through this design, Ledger Nano S can store many more coins than it normally would be able to, but at the same time **it means that in order to install the HPB app you must first install the ETH app in the Manager**, just as you would with any other coin derived from Ethereum.
