# INTRODUCTION
With the Ledger HPB app, you securely store your HPB assets in a Ledger Hardware Wallet. By using a Ledger Hardware Wallet, you don't run into the risk of someone knowing your private keys as the private keys are stored on the Ledger Hardware Wallet and not accessible through your personal computer and thus can not be copied by a third party.

# PREREQUISITES
You will need the following in order to secure your HPB assets with a Ledger device:

* An [initialized](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360000613793) Ledger Nano S with the latest firmware [installed](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360002731113)
* Ledger Live [installed and ready to use](https://support.ledgerwallet.com/hc/en-us/articles/360006395233)
* A web browser such as [Google Chrome](https://www.google.com/chrome/)

3. Give Ledger Live permissions to access your Ledger device by pressing the **right button** on your Ledger device 
4. Because HPB got dependencies to the ETH app, you need to first find the ETH app in the Manager
